# Generic Fullstack Engineer code challenge

This repo is for an ongoing, generic personal project. It contains [frontend](frontend/README.md)  and [backend](backend/Readme.md) code for a generic FSE code challenge. 

It uses React to connect to an ApolloGraphQL server. The ApolloGraphQL server connects to a remote REST API datastore.

Data is pulled from the datastore, through ApolloGraphQL and then displayed to the user as a React UI
